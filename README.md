# SeedPicker

## Caleb Warnock 
He sells seeds [here](https://www.mcssl.com/store/calebwarnock/catalog/search) as a part of the Seed Renaissance movement he is leading, to ensure that our food supply remains in the public domain. Every seed he sells is guaranteed pure, NEVER hybrid, GMO, patented, or corporate owned. All of his seeds are 100% natural, grown without chemicals.

## What I'm Making
SeedPicker allows gardeners to innovate on their planting calendar, optimize crop rotation, produce output, and seed stocking.

## Stack
This is still in progress, but right now I'm trying to go as vanilla as possible. Eventually I'll probably use some Material icons and/or get the npm monster going.
